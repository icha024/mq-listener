# MQ-Listener

A simple webapp to stream all MQ Light messages to the browser.

Handy for debugging and testing. The official MQ Light admin console don't print out the whole message, don't show exact timestamp, and doesn't allow searching recent messages.

1. Start MQ Light locally or edit the code to add remote address/credentials
2. Build/Run the app
```
npm install
node index.js
```
3. Open http://localhost:3333/ in browser
